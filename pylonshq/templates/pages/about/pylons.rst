About The Pylons Project
========================

The Pylons Project is composed of a disparate group of project leaders with
experience going back to the very start of Python web frameworks.
Collectively, we have experience and humility gained by making (and
surviving) every stupid decision that could be imagined.  We aim to bring
fresh ideas to classic web development problems.

Rather than focusing on a single web framework, the Pylons Project will
develop a collection of related technologies.  The first package from the
Pylons Project was the Pyramid web framework. Other packages have been added
to the collection over time, including higher-level components and
applications.  We hope to evolve the project into an ecosystem of
well-tested, well-documented components which interoperate easily.
