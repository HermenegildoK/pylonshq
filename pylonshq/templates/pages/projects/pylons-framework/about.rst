About The Pylons Web Framework
==============================

Pylons 1.0 is a lightweight web framework emphasizing flexibility and rapid
development.

Pylons combines the very best ideas from the worlds of Ruby, Python and Perl,
providing a structured but extremely flexible Python web framework. It's also
one of the first projects to leverage the emerging WSGI standard, which
allows extensive re-use and flexibility â€” but only if you need it. Out of the
box, Pylons aims to make web development fast, flexible and easy.

Pylons 1.X continues its development lifecycle alongside Pyramid as a
subproject of the Pylons Project.
