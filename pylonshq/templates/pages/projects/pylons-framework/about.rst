About The Pylons Framework
==========================

Pylons 1.0 is a lightweight web framework emphasizing flexibility and rapid
development.

Pylons combines the very best ideas from the worlds of Ruby, Python and Perl,
providing a structured but extremely flexible Python web framework. It's also
one of the first projects to leverage the emerging WSGI standard, which
allows extensive re-use and flexibility â€” but only if you need it. Out of the
box, Pylons aims to make web development fast, flexible and easy.

The Pylons web framework 1.x line will continue to be maintained alongside 
Pyramid as a subproject of the Pylons Project, though not enhanced. We will 
provide a package that allows Pylons 1.x applications and Pyramid applications 
to run in the same interpreter. The future of Pylon-style web application 
development is Pyramid.
