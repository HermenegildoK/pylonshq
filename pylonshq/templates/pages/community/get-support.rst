Get Support
===========

Development questions related to Pylons projects can be discussed on the 
`pylons-discuss mail list <http://groups.google.com/group/pylons-discuss/>`_.

On IRC, Pylons developers are generally available on the ``#pylons`` and 
``#pyramid``channels on the `Freenode IRC Network <http://freenode.net/>`_.

Using Support Wisely
--------------------

Before asking a technical question on the maillist(s) or in IRC, please make
sure to try the following things (paraphrased from `Before You Ask
<http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#before>`_):

- Try to find an answer by reading the manual.

- Try to find an answer by searching the maillist archives.

- Try to find an answer by searching the Web.

- Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.

- If you're a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source
  code.

After exhausing these avenues, it's completely appropriate to ask a 
question on the Pylons-devel maillist or #pylons and #pyramid IRC channels. 
When you ask your question, please describe what you've learned from the 
efforts above, as it will help the developers focus on answering your question 
quickly. It also helps tremendously if you are able to provide a code or 
configuration snippet that makes the problem easily repeatable.
