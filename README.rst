PylonsHQ
========

``pylonshq`` is the main website code that will power `pylonsproject.org <http://pylonsproject.org>`_.

Currently, it's mainly a place-holder for Pylons Project documentation as
found here: `Pylons Project Documentation <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/>`_

CSS with Compass
----------------

We're using Compass to generate CSS from SASS so you need to install
`Compass Stylesheet Authoring Framework <http://compass-style.org/>`_,
and compile your SASS using this command:

``compass compile --force``

Any changes made directly to CSS files will be overrided by Compass
upon the next compile.

Update live site
----------------

Until the site is redone with new branding, new tools and deployment process
unification, please notify @blaflamme when PR are merged and deployment has
to be done.
